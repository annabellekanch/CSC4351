Instruction Selection Project 6

Authors: Annabelle Kanchirathingal & James Demaree

Overview:

For this project we implemented instruction selection using Maximal Munch. We mainly referenced chapter 8 of the textbook for this project.

We managed to get the codegen to work properly. With the Maximal Munch Algorithm our main goal was to make sure it generates good assembly code, and we are confident that we have accomplished that.
