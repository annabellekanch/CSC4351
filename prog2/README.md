Lexical Analysis Project 2

Authors: Annabelle Kanchirathingal & James Demaree

Overview:

For this project we created a parser for the CTiger Language using CUP. We mainly referenced chapters 3 and 4 of the textbook and the Tiger Language Reference Manual to understand
the specifications of what we were asked to do. 

Utilizing our little knowledge of CUP we tried our best to implement this parser to work properly. With this parser our main goal was to make sure to consider all of which could be on the parse tree, and we think we have completed that as efficiently as we could. When trying to test our parser with the testcases from prog1 we were met with a few difficulties. We recieved many errors on the java files and none on the CUP file but our tests weren't able to be executed properly. So for that reason and a bit of mismanaged time on our parts we weren't able to properly test our parser. However we believe that because we followed the textbook as a reference the code for our parser should be implemented correctly.
