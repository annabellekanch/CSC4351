# CSC4351 Project 1
Dr. Baumgartener
Lexical Analysis Project

Authors: Annabelle Kanchirathingal & James Demaree

Overview:
    For this project we implemented the features required for a working lexical analyzer for the CTiger language. We mainly utilized the Jlex documentation, Jlex sample code and yylex documentation(https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/html_node/Lexical.html) 

The use of states:
    We made the use of 3 different states to handle comments, strings and escape sequences. 
    State: COMMENT
        explain
    State: STRING
        explain
    State: ESCCHAR
        explain
Error & end-of-file Handling:
    explain
